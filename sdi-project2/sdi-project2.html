<p>Day: 23 - Things are getting worse. Nothing makes sense and we've been traveling for days. We move at night when the zombies can only rely on their sense of hearing. It makes things safer but it's a doubled edged sword. While they have a harder time finding us, we have a hard time seeing them coming as well.
</p>

<p>We arrive a few miles out from a city, I believe we should have someone check it out. JD is showing signs of fatigue, if he can't take point I'll have to rely on Matthews but I don't trust him. Maybe the better idea would be to give a gun to Jeff and Sara and have them do JD's job. With 4 guns and only 200 rounds left we're going to have to conserve ammo. Is it smart to let 2 people run off with fully loaded weapons? If something happens we're out 2 guns and 56 rounds. We have no choice, I'll have to send Matthews to scout out the road ahead. I just hope everything goes well, we cant afford another loss.  </p>

<p>After 2 hours or so Matthews arrives back to us with news of an abandoned base camp, he says "The road's all clear", so we make our way to town. When we arrive, I have a strong sense of urgency. There's something in the air, something like blood. As we start unloading into the building I have a bad feeling so I start looking around. Just as my racing mind is being put to rest I see it, there's something on the floor that looks like blood. As I lean in to get a better look Matthews walks in and stares at me. "You shouldn't worry about that" he says in an unsettling voice. At the moment a small group of 3 men bust into our new camp each holding automatic weapons. "What he hell is going on here? Where is Steve and the others?" he yells. Matthews gives me a look and I know at this point, we're screwed.  </p>
